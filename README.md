# PCA on Image, Audio, and Text Data

This repository contains code for performing PCA on Image, Audio, and Text Data and perform KMeans Clustering on the reduced dimensional dataset and comparing the results of unsupervised learning to a supervised learning technique such as SVM.

Datasets:
- MNIST (Images)
- GTZAN (Audio)
- Reddit Comments (Text)

For the GTZAN Dataset, I have also performed MFCC and Filter Bank extraction to extract features of each song. 
For the Reddit Comments, preprocessing was done to obtain a TF-IDF matrix/weighted matrix.
